# IRCv4 project
The IRCv4 project is an attempt to alleviate frustrations with the IRCv3 working group and perceived slow to nonexistent progress, as well as redesign IRC for the modern era.

This project is a WIP and is just getting off the ground. Be patient!

# Contact
The IRCv4 Working Group is the informal working group for the project. We can be found at [EntropyNet in #irc-wg](ircs://irc.entropynet.org:6697/irc-wg). An unreleased prototype server is in the works for experimentation.

# What's in this repo
The repo contains the following items:
- `schemata/` — schemata for the IRCv4 protocol
- `drafts/` — draft proposals
- `OUTLINE.md` — general outline for the project and loose set of goals
